Updated the storefront platform built with React, GatsbyJS, Stripe, and GraphQL with international shipping capabilities.",
      longSummary: `Nura is a revolutionary audio technology company that creates personalized headphones and earbuds that adapt to your unique hearing profile. As part of the development team, I was responsible for modernizing their e-commerce platform and backend systems.

Key Contributions:
- Led the migration of their legacy Ruby on Rails backend to a more scalable architecture
- Implemented a new React and Gatsby storefront with international shipping capabilities
- Integrated with Contentful for content management and Stripe for payments
- Optimized the GraphQL API for better performance and reliability
- Set up CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code using AWS and Terraform
`,
      challenges: `The main challenge was migrating the legacy system without any downtime or impact on existing customers. This required careful planning, feature flagging, and extensive testing. We also had to handle complex inventory and shipping requirements for international markets.`,
